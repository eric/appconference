INTRODUCTION

This is iaxComm, a portable IAX2 protocol telephony client.

=======================================================================
INSTALLATION

After unzipping, click on the iaxComm icon.

iaxComm needs to be able to see the rc directory.  If you've moved the
executable without moving the rc directory, iaxComm will look for it.
If it can't find them, it will ask you where they are.

To test, type a destination in the text box above the Dial button and
click Dial. NOTE:  If you haven't yet configured servers, you'll need 
to include a username and hostname as well as extension, for example
"guest@misery.digiumcom/s"

You only need to configure a server if you want to register with it
for inbound calls, or simplify your dialling.  If you add a server
called asterisk and set it as your default then dialling "100" would
connect you to "user:password@asterisk/100"

After you've added a couple of Entries in the directory, you can make
them One Touch keys that show up on the main panel.

To use, the intercom feature, set a password in the misc tab of the
Preferences dialog. Any calls to thishost/password@intercom will be answered
automatically.
=======================================================================
PEER TO PEER CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE

This example assumes that you wish to call between two PCs that are PC1
at 192.168.1.1 and PC2 at 192.168.1.2

Just install iaxComm. No need to configure anything.

From PC1, enter 192.168.1.2/s and click Dial.
=======================================================================
ASTERISK CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE

Assume asterisk server at 192.168.1.1
iaxComm user is extension 100, with intercom at extension 200.

Put this in extensions.conf on the asterisk server:

  exten => 100,1,Dial(IAX2/100)
  exten => 200,1,Dial(IAX2/100/password@intercom)


Put this in iax.conf:

  [100]
  type=friend
  host=dynamic
  secret=secret
  context=default

Configure the default server in iaxComm, and set the intercom password to
password.

Now any calls to extension 100 or extension 200 ring to iaxComm on the PC. 
Calls to extension 200 are answered automatically.
