INTRODUCTION

This is iaxComm, a portable IAX2 protocol telephony client.

=======================================================================
INSTALLATION

Unzip or untar, depending on your OS.  There; you're done.

iaxComm no longer needs to be able to see the rc directory, as it did in
previuos versions.

If you've never run iaxComm before, you'll be prompted for account info.
If you want to register with an asterisk server, enter that info now.

You only need to configure an account if you want to register with a
a server for inbound calls, or simplify your dialling.  If you add an
account on a server called asterisk and set it as your default account, 
dialling "100" would connect you to "user:password@asterisk/100"

To test, type a destination in the box above the "Dial" button and click
"Dial". Example:
"guest@misery.digium.com/s"

* LINUX BUG NOTE *
Before you make any calls, you will need to make at least one entry in
your Phone Book (Not a One Touch).

=======================================================================
PEER TO PEER CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE

This example assumes that you wish to call between two PCs that are PC1
at 192.168.1.1 and PC2 at 192.168.1.2

Just install iaxComm. No need to configure anything.

From PC1, enter 192.168.1.2/s and click Dial.
=======================================================================
ASTERISK CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE

Assume asterisk server at 192.168.1.1
iaxComm user is extension 100, with intercom at extension 200.

Put this in extensions.conf on the asterisk server:

  exten => 100,1,Dial(IAX2/100)
  exten => 200,1,Dial(IAX2/100/password@intercom)


Put this in iax.conf:

  [100]
  type=friend
  host=dynamic
  secret=secret
  context=default

(NOTE: You don't want a username= line in iax.conf)

Configure an account in iaxComm with username set to "100", and password
set to "secret".  To enable intercom calls (autoanswered), set the 
intercom password to "password".

Now any calls to extension 100 or extension 200 ring to iaxComm on the PC. 
Calls to extension 200 are answered automatically.
=======================================================================
RINGTONE CONVERSIONS

iaxComm only recognizes 8Khz 16 bit signed raw audio.  You can use sox to
convert standard wav files for use as ringtones with the following command
line:

 sox ringin.wav -c 1 -r 8000 ringin.sw

=======================================================================
SPEEX TUNING

You can now tune serveral of the speex codec parameters.  Note that this
only controls the speex encoder for your outgoing audio.  Incoming audio
quality is controlled by the remote end.

Asterisk has recently added the capability to tune it's speex encoder.  If
you have this capability, it can be adjusted in /etc/asterisk/codecs.conf
