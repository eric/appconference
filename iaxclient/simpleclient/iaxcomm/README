INTRODUCTION

This is iaxComm, a portable IAX2 protocol telephony client.

I had made some minor UI changes to Steve's wx client and renamed it
iaxPhone without realizing there was already another project called
iaxphone.

When I renamed the app to iaxComm, I added minimize to systray functionality
for the Win32 platform, and One Touch keys.

Then I discovered wxWindows' XRC feature, which allows dialog boxen to be
edited without recompiling.  Changing dialog box layout or languages can now
be done without a recompile.

The home page for iaxclient is "http://iaxclient.sourceforge.net/"

BUILDING THE APPLICATION:

NOTE: 

First you must make sure you have XRC support installed.  (Check with wx
Documentation for your platform)

LINUX NOTE:

In order to make linux binaries redistibutable, we need to compile the
wxWindows stuff as static libraries, rather than shared.

1.  Untar the wxWindows source distribution, and cd into it.
2. run configure
    ./configure --disable-shared
3. make and install
    make install
4. Now we need to compile the xrc library
    cd contrib/src/xrc
    make install
5. Since we're now compiling in the xrc resources, we need to compile wxrc
    cd ../../utils/wxrc
    make
    cp wxrc /usr/bin
6. Enjoy wxWindows with all of that xrc-y goodness!
