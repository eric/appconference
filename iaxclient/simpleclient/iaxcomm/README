INTRODUCTION

This is iaxComm, a portable IAX2 protocol telephony client.

I had made some minor UI changes to Steve's wx client and renamed it
iaxPhone without realizing there was already another project called
iaxphone.

When I renamed the app to iaxComm, I added minimize to systray functionality
for the Win32 platform, and One Touch keys.

Then I discovered wxWindows' XRC feature, which allows dialog boxen to be
edited without recompiling.  Changing dialog box layout or languages can now
be done without a recompile.

The home page for iaxclient is "http://iaxclient.sourceforge.net/"
