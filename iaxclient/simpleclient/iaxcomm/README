INTRODUCTION

This is iaxComm, a portable IAX2 protocol telephony client. It is
distributed along with the sources for the iaxclient library.

The home page for iaxclient is "http://iaxclient.sourceforge.net/"

CONTRIBUTORS:

iaxComm evolved from Steve Kann's original wx client.

BUILDING THE APPLICATION:

Here are new, updated instructions for the new wxWidgets 2.6 series:

WINDOWS CYGWIN:

I develop and build iaxComm on a Windows XP box using a cygwin environment
without MinGW.  Here's how I set up my environment:

1. Download and run setup.exe from www.cygwin.com.
   Install the base plus Devel/make and Devel/gcc.

2. Download wxMSW-2.6.2-setup.exe from wxwindows.org
   Install to the default directory, c:\wxWidgets-2.6.2

3. Compile the wxWindows library.  Use the no-cygwin and disable-shared
   options.  You'll also need to disable precompiled headers:

   Start a cygwin session.
    cd c:/wxwindows-2.6.2
    mkdir win32
    cd win32
    CXX="g++ -mno-cygwin" CC="gcc -mno-cygwin" ../configure --disable-shared --disable-precomp-headers
    make install

4.  Now change to this directory and "make"

WINDOWS CYGWIN/MINGW:

These instructions are provided by Jeremy Howard <iaxclient@j.howard.fm>

  - Download and install MinGW, MSYS, and MSYS-DTK current versions
  - Download and install WxWidgets 2.6 (current version)
  - Create WXWIN env var pointing to wherever you install WxWidgets
  - Run MSYS (installed in the Start Menu by default)
  # cd $WXWIN
  # mkdir build-debug
  # ../configure --with-msw --disable-shared \
      --enable-optimise --disable-precomp-headers
  # make
  # make install
  # cd ~/iaxclient/simpleclient/iaxcomm  # or whereever installed
  # make
 
 To make iaxcomm using these directions, you need to apply the patch
 below:

LINUX:

In order to make linux binaries redistibutable, we need to compile the
wxWindows stuff as static libraries, rather than shared.

The rpms on the wxWindows web page do not have xrc support compiled in.
You will need to compile wxWindows from sources.

1. Untar the wxWindows source distribution, and cd into it.
2. run configure
    ./configure --disable-shared
3. make and install
    make install
4. Now we need to compile the xrc library
    cd contrib/src/xrc
    make install
5. Since we're now compiling in the xrc resources, we need to compile wxrc
    cd ../../utils/wxrc
    make
    cp wxrc /usr/bin
6. cd back here and "make"


MACOSX NOTES:

I don't have an OSX box, so I can't offer any advice here.  Everything
*should* build OK, though.
