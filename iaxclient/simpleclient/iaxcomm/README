BUILDING THE APPLICATION:

NOTE: 

First you must make sure you have XRC support installed.  (Check with wx
Documentation for your platform)

WINDOWS NOTE:

It would appear that there is some problem getting wxWindows 2.4.2 to build
under MinGW 3.x.  I've had several people as me for help setting up their
environment, but I'm no expert.  Please note that the versions listed below
work together.

1. Download and run setup.exe from www.cygwin.com.
   Install the base plus Devel/make.
   *** You need to use the make from cygwin ***
   The make in MinGW extras is borken.

2. Download MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe from www.mingw.org.
   Install, accepting defaults

3. Download wxMSW-2.4.2-setup.zip from wxwindows.org
   Install to the default directory, c:\wxWindows-2.4.2

4. Configure the WXWIN environment variable and add cygwin/minGW paths:
   Right click "My Computer".  Click Properties.  Click "Advanced" tab
   Click "Environment Variables"
   Prepend "C:\mingw\bin;c:\cygwin\bin;" to the path
   Create a WXWIN env variable with value "c:/wxwindows-2.4.2" (Note the
   forward slash, rather than back slash.)

5. Compile the wxWindows library.  The docs outline two methods.
   *** DO NOT ./confgure -- USE THE MAKEFILES DIRECTLY ***
   Start a cygwin session.
    cd c:/wxwindows-2.4.2/src/msw
    make -f makefile.g95

6. Compile the XRC support:
    cd c:/wxwindows-2.4.2/contrib/src/xrc
    make -f makefile.g95
    ./minimal.exe

7. Compile the xrc compiler
    cd c:/wxwindows-2.4.2/contrib/utils/wxrc
    make -f makefile.g95
    cp wxrc.exe /usr/bin

8. Enjoy wxWindows with all of that xrc-y goodness!

LINUX NOTE:

In order to make linux binaries redistibutable, we need to compile the
wxWindows stuff as static libraries, rather than shared.

The rpms on the wxWindows web page do not have xrc support compiled in.
You will need to compile wxWindows from sources.

1. Untar the wxWindows source distribution, and cd into it.
2. run configure
    ./configure --disable-shared
3. make and install
    make install
4. Now we need to compile the xrc library
    cd contrib/src/xrc
    make install
5. Since we're now compiling in the xrc resources, we need to compile wxrc
    cd ../../utils/wxrc
    make
    cp wxrc /usr/bin
6. Enjoy wxWindows with all of that xrc-y goodness!


MACOSX NOTES:

1.  wxWindows 2.4.2 (and maybe others) can sometimes crash on Mac OS X.  The solution to this
    that we've found is to just replace mac/thread.cpp with unix/threadpsx.cpp.
