Simple cross platform IAX phone client: version 0.5 By Stephen Uhler

This phone has been tested on Linux/x86, Linux/ppc, Windows/2000-XP,
OSX/PPC, Solaris/sparc, Solaris/x86.  It is likely to work on any system
that supports TK and the underlying client library

INSTALLATION

General installation instructions:
  The user interface files: monitor.ui.tcl, phone.ui.tcl,i and pref.ui.tcl
  should all be in the same directory as "tkiaxphone". so should "iaxcli"
  (or iaxcli.exe on windows).

  iaxcli is named: iaxcli-`uname -m`-`uname -s` on Unix systems to allow
  this to be installed for multiple platforms.

  Make sure the path name to "wish" is correct for your platform in tkiaxphone.
  The default is "/usr/bin/wish".  Tk version at 8.4 is required.

Mac OSX
  Install the Aqua version of tcl/tk.
  (http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/tcltkaqua.html)
  To run "tkiaxphone", double-click on it from the finder.  If you would
  like to run in a wish shell, set the environment variable IAXPHONEHOME
  to the location of the tcl files.

Linux, Solaris
  see: http://www.tcl.tk/ for a suitable version of tcl/tk

Windows
  see: http://www.tcl.tk/ for a suitable version of tcl/tk
  Create a  short cut whose executable is: "<your path to wish> tkiaxphone"
  and set the initial directory to be where the .tcl files are located.
  double-click on the short cut to start the phone.

Using the GUI
  - phone extensions may be entered using either the buttons or keypad.
    alphabetic characters are auctomatically converted to digits
  - the phone must be "registered" to receive calls; to place calls
    "unregistered", leave the user and password empty in the settings panel
  - the kbd shortcuts ^a, ^c, ^e, ^h and ^p may be used to: toggle the audio
    controls, open a console (if available), activate the preferences dialog,
    hang up, and toggle push-to-talk mode respectively.

NOTES

* To receive calls on the phone, it needs to be registered.  Here is
   a sample asterisk iax.conf entry:
     [joe]
     type=friend
     auth=md5,plaintext,rsa
     username=joe
     secret=joe
     context=local
     host=dynamic
     mailbox=1098
     nat=no
     qualify=no
     notransfer=yes
     disallow=all
     allow=gsm
     allow=ulaw
     allow=speex

* Make sure all the files stay in the same directory

* the environment variable DEBUG (or tkiaxphone -d) causes
  diagnostic information on stderr

* The environment variable IAXPHONEHOME is used to locate the
  user interface files.  If not set, they are assumed to be in
  the same directory as "tkiaxphone"

* This phone listens on localhost port 4550 to accept remote commands
  (and to detect multiple instances of the phone running on the same host).
  Commands a single \n terminated lines which result in a single line
  response:
    "who"		returns the registered server and userid
    "expose"		makes the GUI visible
    "die"		kills the phone
    "call nnn"		places a call to nnn

* The phone is designed to be packaged with "freewrap" (see
  freewrap.sourceforge.net) to produce a single file self-contained
  binary.

* There are preferences available in the startup file that are not
  exposed in the preferences GUI.  See the source code for more details.
