Simple IAX phone client for solaris version 0.01 By Stephen Uhler

INSTALLATION

General installation instructions:
  The user interface files: monitor.ui.tcl, phone.ui.tcl,i and pref.ui.tcl
  should all be in the same directory as "tkiaxphone". so should "iaxcli"
  (or iaxcli.exe on windows)

  Make sure the path name to "wish" is correct for your platform in tkiaxphone.
  The default is "/usr/bin/wish".  Any tk version at least 8.0 should work.

Mac OSX
  Install the Aqua version of tcl/tk.
  (http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/tcltkaqua.html)
  To run "tkiaxphone", double-click on it from the finder.  If you would
  like to run in a wish shell, set the environment variable IAXPHONEHOME
  to the location of the tcl files.

Linux, Solaris
  see: http://www.tcl.tk/ for a suitable version of tcl/tk

Windows
  see: http://www.tcl.tk/ for a suitable version of tcl/tk
  Create a  short cut whose executable is: "<your path to wish> tkiaxphone"
  and set the initial directory to be where the .tcl files are located.
  double-click on the short cut to start the phone.

Using the GUI
  - phone extensions may be entered using either the buttons or keypad.
    alphabetic characters are auctomatically converted to digits
  - the phone must be "registered" to receive calls; to place calls
    "unregistered", leave the user and password empty in the settings panel

NOTES

* To receive calls on the phone, it needs to be registered.  Here is
   a sample asterisk iax.conf entry:
     [joe]
     type=friend
     auth=md5,plaintext,rsa
     username=joe
     secret=joe
     context=local
     host=dynamic
     mailbox=1098
     nat=no
     qualify=no
     notransfer=yes
     disallow=all
     allow=gsm

* Make sure all the files stay in the same directory

* the environment variable DEBUG (or tkiaxphone -d) causes
  diagnostic information on stderr


* The environment variable IAXPHONEHOME is used to locate the
  user interface files.  If not set, they are assumed to be in
  the same directory as "tkiaxphone"
