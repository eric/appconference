Building

In order to build the wxWindows GUI client, you must have the wxwindows
library had header files installed on your system.

You can get wxWindows from www.wxwindows.org


The makefiles are set up to build binaries with wxwindows (and
libiaxclient) statically linked.  This will make it such that users of
the binaries will not need wxwindows (or any iacxclient libraries)
installed in order to run the application.


For Linux and MacOSX, you should have "wx-config" installed somewhere in
your PATH when you build.  The default "configure" install of wxwindows
will do this for you.  You might need to build wxwindows with
"--disable-shared" in order to compile the static libraries.


For Win32, when compiling with cygwin/mingw, you'll need to have
wxwindows compiled to static libraries, and the "WXWIN" environment
variable set to the location of your wxwindows installation.

Contributions sought:

The contribution of Step-by-step build directions, especially for Win32
developers,  is encouraged, and will be included here in this README.
If you can write such directions, please send them to the
iaxclient-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list, and we can include
them here for the benefit of others.

Also, if someone would like to contribute MSVC "project files" (i.e. a
.dsp/.dsw file set), and directions for those building with MSVC, those
would also be helpful for people afraid of the command-line.

Building WXWindows on Win32, with MinGW/Cygwin:

These were the steps taken by 
Michael Van Donselaar <mvand@vandonselaar.org> to build wx on
his box, and are similar to what were taken for the initial development:

(Thanks to Michael for contributing these directions)
After tearing out what little hair I have left, I've finally gotten this
figured out.

The two things that bit me were a borken make in minGW and using
./configure to configure wxWindows.

The docs in  wxWindows say there's two ways to compile: directly with
the makefiles, or using configure.  ./configure is your friend right?
Wrong.  Use the makefiles directly.

I have verified the following for WinXP and for Win2000.  Steve, feel
free to include these in your README.

1)  Download and run setup.exe from www.cygwin.com.
    Install the base plus Devel/make.
    *** You need to use the make from cygwin ***
    The make in MinGW extras is borken.

2)  Download MinGW-2.0.0-3.exe from www.mingw.org.
    Install, accepting defaults

3)  Download wxMSW-2.4.1-setup.zip from wxwindows.org
    Install to the default directory, c:\wxWindows-2.4.1

4)  Configure the WXWIN environment variable and add cygwin/minGW paths:
    Right click "My Computer".  Click Properties.  Click "Advanced" tab
    Click "Environment Variables"
    Prepend "C:\mingw\bin;c:\cygwin\bin;" to the path
    Create a WXWIN env variable with value "c:/wxwin-2.4.1" (Note the
    forward slash, rather than back slash.)

5)  Compile the wxWindows library.  The docs outline two methods.
    *** DO NOT ./confgure -- USE THE MAKEFILES DIRECTLY ***
    Start a cygwin session. 
    cd c:/wxwindows-2.4.1/src/msw
    make -f makefile.g95

6)  Test the wxWindows library:
    cd c:/wxwindows-2.4.1/samples/minimal
    make -f makefile.g95 minimal
    ./minimal.exe

7)  Install the iaxclient sources in /usr/src/iaxclient
    cd /usr/src/iaxclient/simpleclient/wx
    make
    strip wx
    ./wx.exe
