Building

In order to build the wxWindows GUI client, you must have the wxwindows
library had header files installed on your system.

You can get wxWindows from www.wxwindows.org


The makefiles are set up to build binaries with wxwindows (and
libiaxclient) statically linked.  This will make it such that users of
the binaries will not need wxwindows (or any iacxclient libraries)
installed in order to run the application.


For Linux and MacOSX, you should have "wx-config" installed somewhere in
your PATH when you build.  The default "configure" install of wxwindows
will do this for you.  You might need to build wxwindows with
"--disable-shared" in order to compile the static libraries.


For Win32, when compiling with cygwin/mingw, you'll need to have
wxwindows compiled to static libraries, and the "WXWIN" environment
variable set to the location of your wxwindows installation.


=============================================================
Contributions sought:

The contribution of Step-by-step build directions, especially for Win32
developers,  is encouraged, and will be included here in this README.
If you can write such directions, please send them to the
iaxclient-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list, and we can include
them here for the benefit of others.

Also, if someone would like to contribute MSVC "project files" (i.e. a
.dsp/.dsw file set), and directions for those building with MSVC, those
would also be helpful for people afraid of the command-line.
